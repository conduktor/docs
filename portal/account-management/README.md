# Account Management

When you register a Conduktor account, you have access to Conduktor Desktop and to our portal: [account.conduktor.io](https://account.conduktor.io). (same account, same credentials)

### The Roles in the Portal

#### Billing Users

If you purchased a subscription, you are its BILLING USER. You are the **ADMIN** of the subscription, you can do anything.

* You will have access to the invoices, billing info, you will be able to purchase more licenses in seconds.
* You will also be able to **assign/unassign licenses** to your users (_please note that reassignment is only available for Enterprise subscriptions)_&#x20;
* Designate License Managers to manage your licenses on behalf of you

#### License Managers

A Billing User can designate one or more License Managers to manage the license on its behalf.&#x20;

* No access to the invoices, billing info etc.
* You will also be able to **assign/unassign licenses** to your users (_please note that reassignment is only available for Enterprise subscriptions)_&#x20;

It's useful for _team leaders_ for instance, who are not the ones purchasing the subscription (eg: when going through _resellers_, _procurement_ etc.)

#### Regular Conduktor Users

You did not purchased your license yourself, but your company did?

* You will be able to see your current license.
