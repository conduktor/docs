# Account Management

When you register a Conduktor account, you have access to Conduktor Desktop and to our portal: [account.conduktor.io](https://account.conduktor.io/). (same account, same credentials)

### The Roles in the Portal

#### "Owner"

If you purchased a subscription, you are the “Owner”. You are the **ADMIN** and have the most administrative privileges available to your subscription. This role is purely administrative and does not count as one of the licenses assigned to your subscription.

The role of “_Owner_” means:&#x20;

* You do not count towards the overall number of licenses.&#x20;
* You have access to the invoices and billing information and will be the point of contact in relation to billing for your subscription.&#x20;
* You can make changes to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Conduktor.&#x20;
* You will be able to add “_Team Managers_” as well as “_Members_” to your subscription.&#x20;
  * “_Team Managers_” are an administrative role and can add or revoke “_Members_” and do not count towards the number of assigned licenses.
  * “_Members_” are Conduktor users who do count toward the number of assigned licenses.

**“Team Manager”**

An “Owner” can designate one or more “_Team Managers_” to manage the license on his/her behalf. The role of “_Team Manager_” means:&#x20;

* You do not count towards the overall number of licenses.&#x20;
* You have no access to the invoices, billing info, etc.&#x20;
* You can make changes to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Conduktor.&#x20;
* You can add/revoke licenses to your “_Members_” or users on your subscription (please note that reassignment is only available for Enterprise subscriptions).

**“Member”**

The role of “_Member_” or user of Conduktor means:

* You do count towards the number of licenses available on your subscription.
* You can be both an “_Owner_” / ”_Team Manager_” and a ”_Member_”.
* You cannot make changes to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Conduktor.&#x20;
* You will be able to see your current license on the account management system.&#x20;
* If you have any questions regarding your subscription, please ask your account's “_Owner_”.
