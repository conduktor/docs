# Account Management

When you register a Conduktor account, you have access to Conduktor Desktop and to our portal: [account.conduktor.io](https://account.conduktor.io/). \(same account, same credentials\)

### The Roles in the Portal

#### Billing Users

If you purchased a subscription, you are a BILLING USER.

* You will have access to the invoices, billing info, you will be able to purchase more licenses in seconds.
* You will also be able to **assign licenses** to your users
* Designate License Managers to manage your licenses on behalf of you

#### License Managers

A Billing User can designate one or more License Managers to manage the license on its behalf. 

You will be able to remove and assign license to any users. It's useful for team leaders for instance, who are not the ones purchasing the subscription \(resellers, procurement etc.\)

#### Regular Conduktor Users

If you're just a Conduktor user, that you didn't purchase your license yourself, you will be able to only see your current license.
