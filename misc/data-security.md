# Data Security

## How are my data and configurations used?

### Configuration: on your computer only

Conduktor Desktop, installed on your computer, stores its configuration on your computer. It is not stored nor send anywhere else. It may contain some username & password used in Conduktor Desktop to connect to the different technologies: Apache Kafka, Schema Registry etc.

### Data: not sent anywhere

The data only transits between your Conduktor Desktop and your Apache Kafka clusters and ecosystem \(Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, ksqlDB, ...\). They are not send anywhere else.

### Data Flow

Data transits only on your enterprise network because Conduktor instances and your brokers & applications.

## Where is my configuration?

Your Conduktor configuration is stored in a fixed place on your computer:

## Where are the logs?

## Analytics / Error reporting

![Check the option on our welcome screen to help us :\)](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-02-15-at-10.59.49.png)

When the option "Analytics/Reports" is checked on our welcome screen, we will send some signals to:

* Google Analytics \(totally anonymized\): about which dialog is opened, which button was clicked etc. This will help us determining some screens are super used or not used at all.
* Sentry: only in case of errors, we send the error to Sentry to provide us visibility, if a feature is broken.

## Support: Ask us Anything!

![We are here to help us!](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-02-15-at-11.30.03.png)

Listening to our users is super important. We provide many spots in our interface, for the users  to contact us in case of questions/issues/feature requests.

This send us directly an email to support@conduktor.io where we continue the conversation in a classical manner. Details are kept purely private in the email conversation, and not sent anywhere.

## Login / Licenses

To use Conduktor, login is mandatory. This allows us to know our users and control if they have a license or not \(to provide access to more features etc.\).

### Security

To ensure a maximum security and availability of the login system, we use auth0 to manage our userbase which is fully certified, highly secured, and highly available. \([https://auth0.com/security](https://auth0.com/security)\)

### Identification Flow

Conduktor contacts auth0 when the user logins \(on [https://auth.conduktor.io/](https://auth.conduktor.io/)\). The user can register or login on auth0 secured pages, which then provide a secured JWT to Conduktor on the machine.
