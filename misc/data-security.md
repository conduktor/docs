# Data Security

## Where are my data and configurations stored?

Conduktor Desktop, installed on your computer, stores its configuration on your computer. It is not stored nor send anywhere else.

The data only transits between your Conduktor Desktop and your Apache Kafka clusters and ecosystem \(Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, ksqlDB, ...\). They are not send anywhere else.



## Analytics

When the option "Analytics/Reports" is checked on our welcome screen, we will send some signals to Google Analytics \(totally anonymous\) about which dialog is opened, which button was clicked etc.

This will help us determining some screens are super used or not used at all.
