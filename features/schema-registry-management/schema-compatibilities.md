# Schema Compatibilities

Confluent has a really [good article](https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/avro.html) about compatibility.

Long story short, there are "7" modes of compatibility handled by the Schema Registry:

* None
* Forward
  * Transitive
* Backward
  * Transitive
* Full
  * Transitive
