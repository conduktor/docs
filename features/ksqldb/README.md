# ksqlDB: Streaming with SQL

Conduktor only fully supports ksqlDB from v0.10.x and was tested until v0.14. Don't hesitate to contact us if you stumbled upon some issues. ksqlDB is still in development \(&lt;1.0\), so they may break things for the sake of evolution. We try our best to be compatible with all versions.

Follow the guide!
