## List Connectors

There are many information when it comes to Connectors!

* **Instance / Name**: instance is only displayed if you have multiple Kafka Connect instances configured, to distinguish between them
* **Class**: the plugin used
* **Type**: quickly understand what this connector does
* **Topics**: which topics do the connector listens from or writes into
* **Status / Tasks**: red means trouble!

Here is a typical example with 6 Kafka Connect instances for multiple environnements:

## Error Management

Conduktor displays the connectors on the main list in error \(clearly in red\). In the details, it's possible to look at which task failed and why:

## Restart / Pause / Stop

It's possible to restart a Connector or simply a task \(or all tasks at once, different of a full connector restart\).

* Restart a Connector
* Pause/Resume a Connector
* Restart ALL the tasks of a Connector
* Restart a particular task of a Connector
*

### Connector States

A connector and its tasks can have different states:

* RUNNING
* FAILED
* PAUSED
* UNASSIGNED: no worker is picking it up!

## Reset Connector Source Offsets

Kafka Connect stores connectors state inside Kafka itself.

Sometimes \(mostly when testing\), you want to reset a connector to start from "scratch", as it was the first time ever you've started it. Unfortunately, **removing a Connector does not delete its state from Kafka**. You can either:

* change the Connector name: Kafka Connect won't find any existing state obviously
* reset the source offsets: using Conduktor!

Conduktor will look for the partition containing the latest occurence of your connector configuration, to know "where" to reset it.

Here is an example:

* my connector name: "my-connector" which is already stopped \(ie: removed\)
* my Kafka Connect offsets topic: "docker-connect-offsets"
* Click Lookup and let Conduktor find the partition and latest value
* Select the key and "RESET SOURCE OFFSETS"
* Restart your Connector \(re-create it\), it will start from scratch

## Create Connectors

We provide a wizard to easily create connectors. The available connector types depend on the Kafka Connect instance you're creating a connector. You can also simply load a JSON to init the wizard:

When you pick a Sink or a Source connector type \(or Create From JSON\), you have access to a nice wizard properly organized and fully documented \(just hover the property names\).

For instance, here, one of the step of the Elasticsearch Sink Connector:

## Update Connector

It's possible to update a Connector by using this same wizard or simply by providing an updated JSON.
