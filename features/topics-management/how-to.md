## How to consume data from a Topic?

Several ways:

* from the top bar: add a Consumer and select your topic inside
* from the topic list: the inspect button next to the name of the topic
* from the topic details view: from the _CONSUME DATA_ button

Also see [Consuming data ](../consuming-data/)for all the details.

## How to reset the offsets of a Topic?

The question is more: _how to reset the offsets for a Consumer Group and a Topic it has subscribed to?_

The offsets of a Topic cannot be "reset". The offsets are ever growing for all partitions of a Topic \(data incoming into a Topic =&gt; offsets increases\). 

Go to the Consumer Group itself, and Reset Offsets from here.
